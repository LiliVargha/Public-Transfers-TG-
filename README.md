# Public Transfer (TG) Age Profiles in 50 countries and Public Transfer Clusters

This repository contains the replication file for clustering Public Transfer (TG) age profiles and visualizing the results using line plots and heatmaps for 50 countries.

The public transfers in these figures are the age specific differences between public transfer inflows (benefits) and outflows (contributions) that are mediated by the public sector. The most important public transfer inflows are pensions, education, health services and general public services. The outflows consist mainly of taxes and social contributions registered in National Accounts. The figure shows which generations are beneficiaries and contributors of public transfers from age 0 till 85+. The values are averages calculated using  National Accounts, administrative and survey data in the different countries. The values at each age are normalized using the average labour income of age 30-49. Data is from 2002-2016, the most recent country estimations. Clustering is done using a data driven way: using Ward's clustering. For more details on this see the presentation on the typology of economic lifecycles [References below] and the replication files. For more details on the data see documentation of the data sources.

## Data source
1. [Global NTA results](https://www.ntaccounts.org/web/nta/show/Browse%20database) (Lee and Mason 2011)
2. [European AGENTA Project](http://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/nta/) (Isteni훾 et al. 2019)

## Replication files
The file for replication is [VIZTG.R](https://github.com/LiliVargha/Public-Transfers_TG/blob/main/VIZTG.R). The file contains explanations, all the different visualizations and the clustering.
